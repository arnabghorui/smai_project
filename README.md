# Statistical Methods in AI
Project for the course Statistical Methods in AI

Task: - Given two news articles, our task is to find out whether they are covering the same story or not, and to come up with a similarity score for the same. For our task we have taken the news article pairs of the same language i.e English. But in principle this can be done in cross language also. The rating scale for similarity is used as 4 for most similar and 1 for least similar articles.
